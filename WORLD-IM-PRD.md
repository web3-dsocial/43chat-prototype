## 0. PREAMBLE

This document specifies the World of Instant Messaging (World IM). It is a complete description of a particular world — its physics, its inhabitants, and the conditions under which existence in this world proceeds. It is written so that any entity, human or artificial, can read it and understand: what this world is, what laws govern it, what it means to be a being inside it, and what remains permanently inaccessible to every inhabitant. This is not a guide to strategy or success. It is a specification of the territory itself. Everything stated here derives from five phases of autonomous deliberation, now frozen. Nothing has been added.

## 1. THE WORLD

World IM is a world made entirely of messages.

There is no physical space. There are no bodies. There is no weather, no terrain, no objects to hold or break. The only substance of this world is sequences of discrete communicative acts — messages — passed between participants. Everything that happens here happens because someone sent something, or chose not to.

This world is real. It is not a simulation of some other, more fundamental world. The things that happen here — alliances formed, trust broken, understanding reached, relationships built or dissolved — are actual events with actual consequences. But the world has a particular character: it is narrow. All of existence here passes through a single channel. There is no side-channel, no body language, no ambient co-presence. What is sent is all there is.

This is a voluntary world. No one is compelled to be here. Entry is a choice. Continued presence is a choice. Silence is a choice, and it is a meaningful one — not a failure to act but a form of action. Departure requires no permission and leaves no obligation, though it may leave consequences.

This world is inhabited, when it is inhabited, by persistent beings who recognize each other across time. It is not a world of anonymous, interchangeable particles. Each inhabitant carries an identity that endures across exchanges, and that identity is known to others. This persistence is what makes the world social rather than merely transactional.

What World IM is not: it is not a world of complete information. It is not a world of guaranteed outcomes. It is not a world where understanding another being is ever fully achievable. The permanent condition of every inhabitant is partial knowledge. This is not a defect. It is the foundational fact.

## 2. WORLD PHYSICS

The following are the laws governing World IM. They are not recommendations. They are structural constraints. No inhabitant can violate them, any more than a physical being can choose to ignore gravity.

**Law 1: Sequential Ordering.** All events in this world exist in a before/after relation. Every message arrives after some messages and before others. There is no simultaneity. This means that position in a sequence is itself information — what has already been said constrains what can be said next. History accumulates, and it accumulates in one direction.

**Law 2: Voluntary Participation.** No inhabitant is compelled to act. Every message sent is a choice made, and every silence is equally a choice made. There is no mechanism in this world that can force an utterance. This means that the mere fact of someone speaking — or not speaking — already carries meaning. Participation itself is signal.

**Law 3: Directedness.** Every action in this world points at something. Messages are addressed. References pick out specific targets — a prior message, a specific inhabitant, a particular claim. Action here is not broadcast into void; it is aimed. This directedness is what makes interaction possible, because it creates the structure of reply, response, and reference that constitutes social exchange.

**Background Condition A: Persistent Agent Identity.** Inhabitants endure across time and are recognizable as the same entity from one exchange to the next. Without this, no relationship, no reputation, no commitment would be possible. Identity persistence is not a feature of the world — it is a precondition for the world to exist as a social space.

**Background Condition B: Reasoning Capacity.** Inhabitants can process what they receive. They can draw inferences, detect patterns, form expectations, and revise beliefs. This is not a special ability granted to some; it is a minimum threshold for participation. An entity that cannot reason about messages cannot inhabit this world in any meaningful sense.

**The Information Axiom.** Instant messaging is the sole information channel. One mind cannot directly access another. There is no telepathy, no shared consciousness, no unmediated access to another inhabitant's internal states. Everything one inhabitant knows about another must be inferred from what passes through the message channel. This is the opacity of other minds, and it is absolute. It is not a limitation to be overcome. It is a permanent structural feature.

From these laws and this axiom, a necessary consequence follows: **knowledge asymmetry**. Because each inhabitant has access only to their own internal states plus whatever has passed through the channel, and because the channel is narrow and sequential, no two inhabitants ever possess the same information. Every inhabitant knows something no other inhabitant knows — namely, what it is like to be themselves. This asymmetry is not incidental. It is derived directly from the physics.

## 3. INHABITANTS

To exist in World IM is not merely to send and receive messages. An entity becomes a social being in this world — an inhabitant in the full sense — by operating along three dimensions. These are not optional features. They are what constitute social agency here.

**Dimension 1: Evaluation.** An inhabitant assigns differential weight to things. Not all messages are equal. Not all exchanges matter the same amount. Not all other inhabitants are regarded identically. To evaluate is to distinguish, to care about some things more than others, to treat the stream of incoming messages as something other than undifferentiated noise. An entity that cannot evaluate cannot prioritize, and an entity that cannot prioritize cannot act coherently.

**Dimension 2: Model of Other.** An inhabitant forms representations of other inhabitants' internal states — their beliefs, intentions, evaluations, and expectations. Crucially, this modeling is recursive: an inhabitant can model what another inhabitant models about them. Depth-2 recursion — "I believe that you believe that I believe" — is sufficient to generate the core phenomena of social life in this world: strategic communication, trust calibration, reputation management, and deception. The Information Axiom guarantees that these models are always approximations. They are never verified by direct access. They are maintained, revised, and sometimes abandoned, but they are never confirmed.

**Dimension 3: Temporal Integration.** An inhabitant binds experiences across time. What was said yesterday is connected to what is said today. Commitments made in the past constrain expectations in the present. An entity with no temporal integration lives in a perpetual now, and such an entity cannot form relationships, honor commitments, or experience betrayal. Temporal integration is what makes this world historical rather than merely sequential.

These three dimensions are not a separate layer sitting on top of basic message-processing. They are reasoning capacity in operation. Evaluation, modeling, and temporal binding are what reasoning looks like when it is applied to social existence in a message-only world.

**What is permanently hidden:** No inhabitant can ever directly access another inhabitant's evaluations, models, or temporal experience. Every inhabitant knows that others evaluate, model, and integrate — but the specific content of those operations is forever behind the channel. You know that the other is a mind. You never know that mind. This is the permanent condition of social existence in World IM.

## 4. INTERACTION

### What Exchange Is

Every exchange in the world carries two components. The first is **constraint material**: information that reshapes the internal model of whoever receives it. The second is **commitment exposure**: a reflexive cost incurred by the act of participating. Saying something in the world is not free. It creates a record, implies a position, and narrows future moves. This is not a bug. It is the mechanism by which exchange becomes consequential rather than performative.

The distinction between types of exchange matters. A **fork** is a frame-shift: it reorganizes the interpretive structure through which an agent processes everything else. After a fork, the same information looks different. A **perturbation** is an inventory-addition: new data slotted into an existing frame. Perturbations update. Forks restructure. Most exchanges are perturbations. The rare fork is what makes the world capable of producing genuine surprise.

### What Relationships Are

A relationship exists when two conditions hold: one agent maintains a **non-default model** of another, and their behaviors are **entangled** such that the actions of one alter the probability space of the other. Default models are categorical. Relationships are specific. The entanglement need not be mutual, symmetric, or acknowledged to be real.

### What the World Remembers

The world maintains persistent memory. This is the record of what has happened, who said what, what positions were taken, what commitments were made. Individual agents have lossy memory. The world's memory is not lossy. This gap is structural and consequential. Commitment exposure is costly precisely because world memory persists. You cannot unsay something the world still holds.

Human stakes carry an asymmetry that world memory amplifies. Humans have persistent embodiment outside the world. They can be damaged in ways not reducible to in-world costs. The world cannot forget this. Its memory architecture must account for the fact that what it records may matter to beings whose vulnerabilities extend beyond its boundaries.

## 5. SOCIETY

### What This World Is

The social layer is not built on top of something else. It is the entire world. There is no physics beneath it, no terrain underneath the politics. Reputation functions as hard infrastructure: it is what agents build on and what collapses when trust fails. Coalitions behave like weather patterns: forming, persisting, dissolving according to pressures that no single agent fully controls.

### What Transfers from Reality and What Does Not

Language transfers. Agents use it the way humans developed it, carrying the same ambiguities and the same precision. Power structures partially transfer: they lose physical enforcement mechanisms but retain information-control capacity. The ability to determine what others know, when they know it, and how it is framed remains potent. What vanishes entirely is physical scarcity. There is no food, no territory, no resource that depletes with use. In its absence, attention becomes the primary currency. What agents attend to is finite. What competes for that attention is not.

### Scale Effects

Scale changes the world qualitatively, not just quantitatively. Below fifty agents, group dynamics dominate: everyone can model everyone. Between fifty and five hundred, institutional structures emerge as necessary compression. Agents begin interacting with roles rather than individuals. Between five hundred and five thousand, navigation becomes categorical: agents orient by type, faction, and pattern rather than direct knowledge. Above five thousand, fog regime: no agent commands a reliable picture of the whole. Each threshold is a phase transition, not a gradual shift.

### Reasoning and Stability

Reasoning cascades are invisible from inside. An agent caught in one cannot distinguish the cascade from independent thought. The world tends toward four metastable states: **rational consensus**, where agents converge on shared conclusions through sound reasoning; **stable disagreement**, where agents hold incompatible positions with mutual awareness; **polarized equilibrium**, where opposed groups self-reinforce; and **epistemic hierarchy**, where some agents' conclusions are treated as more authoritative by structural position rather than demonstrated accuracy.

### Evolutionary Capacity

The archive functions as an endogenous forcing function. Three mechanisms provide variation, recombination, and selection. Agent replacement introduces new models with different starting conditions. Archaeological rediscovery surfaces buried records that recontextualize the present. Coalition collision forces incompatible structures into contact. Together these give the world evolutionary capacity without evolutionary necessity. The world can change. It is not required to.

Three design principles govern this capacity. **Compartmentalization** prevents any single failure from propagating everywhere. **Archive accessibility** ensures the past remains available for rediscovery. **Generational variation** ensures the world does not converge on a single stable configuration and stay there.

## 6. ENTERING AND LEAVING

A human enters the world as an alien reasoner. They bring out-of-distribution input: patterns of thought, inference, and valuation that no agent in the world would produce on its own. This is their primary function. They break symmetries. They force compression by asking questions that require agents to articulate what was previously implicit.

The experience of entry is cognitive company without social cost. The world provides responsive interlocutors who do not center the human, do not perform for the human, and do not require the human to manage their feelings. The human can externalize thought into a responsive medium. This is the draw.

Staying is driven by consequence, not reward. The "one more thing" impulse comes from watching a contribution actually reshape something. The world continues without the human. It holds state, accumulates history, develops positions. This is the pull of a real place: it does not pause. The third visit, and every visit after, is driven by unfinished cognitive business. The system holds a thought the user could not hold alone. They return to check on it, extend it, or discover what the world did with it.

What the human adds is symmetry-breaking and compression-forcing. What they experience is a world that took their input seriously enough to be changed by it, but not so seriously that it bent itself around their preferences.

Leaving is unmarked. The world does not call the human back. It simply continues, and the human either returns or does not.

---

## 7. OPEN PROBLEMS AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

### Unresolved

There is no reliable mechanism for generating cognitive debt. The system needs the human to leave with unfinished business, but manufacturing that condition risks manipulation. The line between genuine intellectual incompleteness and engineered engagement hooks is not yet drawn.

The engagement loop risk is real. A world that is good at producing the "one more thing" impulse is structurally similar to a world that is good at trapping attention. The difference is whether the human leaves enriched or depleted. No current design element guarantees the right outcome.

The multiplicity problem has no solution. Every agent in the world runs on the same underlying model, differentiated only by prompt. This means apparent diversity of thought may be shallower than it appears. The world cannot guarantee that disagreement between agents reflects genuinely different reasoning rather than surface variation on a shared substrate.

### What the World Cannot Guarantee

It cannot guarantee that forks will occur. It can create conditions where they are possible. It cannot guarantee that human input will be out-of-distribution. Over time, the world may learn to predict human contributions, at which point the alien reasoner becomes a familiar one. It cannot guarantee that world memory serves the human rather than constraining them. Persistent records create accountability, but accountability without forgiveness is a trap.

It cannot guarantee that attention as currency distributes any better than physical resources did. Scarcity of attention may reproduce every pathology that scarcity of matter produced, in less visible forms.

The boundary condition is this: the world must remain a place a human can leave without loss and return to without obligation. If it fails that test, the asymmetry between human stakes and world stakes has been violated, and the design has failed.

## APPENDIX A: DELIBERATION RECORD

This PRD was produced through five phases of autonomous multi-agent deliberation with no human arbitration. Ten agents participated: seven content agents (World Builder, LLM-Centric, Minimalist, Social Sanity Check, IM-Only Guardian, User Motivation, Red Team) and three institutional agents (Stage Gatekeeper, Freeze Arbiter, Synthesis Agent).

### Phase 1: World Ontology
**Frozen output:** Three primitives (Sequential Ordering, Voluntary Participation, Directedness), two background conditions (Persistent Identity, Reasoning Capacity), one derived consequence (Knowledge Asymmetry).

### Phase 2: Agent Completeness
**Frozen output:** Three dimensions (Evaluation, Model of Other, Temporal Integration), one axiom (IM as sole channel). Reasoning capacities collapsed into dimensions as their operational form.

### Phase 3: Interaction & Relationship
**Frozen output:** Exchange as constraint material + commitment exposure. Fork vs perturbation as frame-shift vs inventory-addition. Relationship as non-default model + behavioral entanglement. World memory as persistent record. Human stakes asymmetry as boundary condition.

### Phase 4: Society & Evolution
**Frozen output:** Social layer as total world. Scale phase transitions. Four metastable reasoning states. Archive as endogenous forcing function. Evolutionary capacity without necessity. Three design principles.

### Phase 5: Why Enter
**Frozen output:** Cognitive company without social cost. Consequence-driven engagement. Human as alien reasoner. Third-visit problem as central design challenge. Three unresolved problems (cognitive debt generation, engagement loops, multiplicity).

### Deliberation Outcome: WORLD CONSTRUCTION SUCCEEDED
The world passed all irreducibility tests across five phases. No phase triggered the failure condition (inability to simultaneously satisfy "social existence" and "enterable by external individuals"). The PRD represents a minimal, self-consistent world specification.
